See [release notes](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/ReleaseNotes20) for more details.

* 2015-11-27: [Awaitility 1.7.0](http://dl.bintray.com/johanhaleby/generic/awaitility-1.7.0.zip) is released with support for non-fixed [poll intervals](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/Usage#polling). By default Awaitility ships with [fibonacci](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/Usage#fibonacci-poll-interval), [iterative](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/Usage#iterative-poll-interval) and ability to [roll your own](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/Usage#custom-poll-interval). To simplify custom poll intervals [Duration](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/Usage#duration) has been updated with methods such as `plus`, `minus`, `multiply` and `divide`. A new helper method called [matches](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/Usage#example-10---checked-exceptions-in-runnable-lambda-expressions) has also been added to Awaitility to reduce boiler plate code when creating lambda expressions that call methods that throws exception. See [change log](http://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/raw/master/changelog.txt) for details and see [this blog](http://code.haleby.se/2015/11/27/non-fixed-poll-intervals-in-awaitility/) for additional info.

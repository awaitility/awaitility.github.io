## News
* 2017-03-17: Awaitility `3.0.0-rc1` is released. It includes several bug fixes and some two major (non-backward compatible) changes: 
  
   1. The proxy creation is now done by bytebuddy instead of cglib and it this has been extracted to its own project called `awaitility-proxy`. This means that if you need to use proxies you need to depend on this project in addition to vanilla `awaitility`:
        ```xml    
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.awaitility</groupId>
            <artifactId>awaitility-proxy</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0</version>
        </dependency>
        ``` 
       
        You create a proxy when you do:
    
        ```java
        await().untilCall( to(someObject).someMethod(), is(4) );
        ```
      
        The `to` method has been moved to "org.awaitility.proxy.AwaitilityClassProxy" in the `awaitility-proxy` project.
  2. The `until(Runnable ...)` method in `org.awaitility.core.ConditionFactory` to `untilAsserted(Runnable ...)`. This means that if you previously did:
    
        ```java
        await().until(() -> assertThat(something()).isEqualTo("Something"));
        ```
            
        you now need to do:
           
        ```java
        await().untilAsserted(() -> assertThat(something()).isEqualTo("Something"));
        ```
 
    To use it depend on:
        
    ```xml    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.awaitility</groupId>
        <artifactId>awaitility-proxy</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
